     * await, or when being called back from an async database request or anything that isn't directly executing in the route handler, you'll want

     * such calls, in one atomic IO operation. This is important, not only for TCP but definitely for TLS where each write would otherwise result
     * in one TLS block being sent off, each with one send syscall.

     *
